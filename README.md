# TKSAT-1_Optimization_Project
This project optimizes South orbital correction maneuvers for the Bolivian TKSAT-1 satellite using Machine Learning. Predictive models like RNN-LSTM and Random Forest were trained to minimize fuel consumption, maintain orbital stability, and extend the satellite's lifespan, achieving significant savings and improved operational efficiency.
